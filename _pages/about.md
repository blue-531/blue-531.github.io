I am a 5th year Ph.D. student advised by Prof. [Kuk-Jin Yoon](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=1NvBj_gAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Visual Intelligence Lab (VILab)](https://vi.kaist.ac.kr/), Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). 
I am set to graduate in February 2025 and am actively seeking a postdoctoral or research position.
<br/>

I am dedicated to advancing the understanding and prediction of environmental data through innovative approaches that utilize minimal or weak annotations, significantly reducing the annotation burden.
I have tackled a range of tasks such as semantic segmentation, data completion, and representation learning, consistently pushing the boundaries of these fields.
My expertise spans various data modalities, including image, point cloud, and event data.
